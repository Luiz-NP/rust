  <h3>The famous convention, here is my first rust program!</h3>  
</div>

```rs
  fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");  
  }
```

### Some interesting points:
  * #### The main function is the first thing to be called in a rust program.
  ```rs
    fn main() {}
  ```
  * #### The line inside the function is not a function.
  ```rs
    println!();
  ```
  * #### Note the "!" sign, this is the callsign for a rust macro.
